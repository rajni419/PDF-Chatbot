## Configuration

### Step 1: Create Environment File

We've provided a `sample.env` file. Follow these steps:

1. **Locate the `sample.env` file** in the project root

2. **Copy and rename it to `.env`:**

   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
   ```cmd
   copy sample.env .env
   ```

   **On macOS/Linux (Terminal):**
   ```bash
   cp sample.env .env
   ```

   **Or manually:**
   - Right-click `sample.env`
   - Select "Copy"
   - Paste and rename to `.env`

### Step 2: Add Your API Key

Open the `.env` file in any text editor and replace the placeholder:

**Before:**
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

**After:**
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t
```

⚠️ **Important:** 
- No spaces around the `=` sign
- No quotes needed
- Keep the `.env` file in the project root directory

### Step 3: Verify `.gitignore`

Make sure your `.env` file won't be committed to Git:

Check if `.gitignore` contains:
```
.env
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

---

## Running Locally

### Step 1: Activate Virtual Environment

Make sure your virtual environment is activated (see Installation Step 2)

### Step 2: Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run main2.py
```

Or if you named your file differently:
```bash
streamlit run your_filename.py
```

### Step 3: Access the Application

The app will automatically open in your default browser at:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

If it doesn't open automatically, manually go to the URL shown in the terminal.

## Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Your code pushed to a GitHub repository

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

⚠️ **Make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore`** - Never push API keys to GitHub!

### Step 2: Go to Streamlit Cloud

1. Visit: [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
2. Click "Sign up" or "Sign in with GitHub"
3. Authorize Streamlit to access your GitHub

### Step 3: Deploy New App

1. Click **"New app"** button
2. Fill in the deployment settings:
   - **Repository:** Select your GitHub repo
   - **Branch:** `main` (or your default branch)
   - **Main file path:** `main2.py`

### Step 4: Add Secrets (API Keys)

This is crucial - you need to add your API key securely:

1. Click on **"Advanced settings"**
2. In the **"Secrets"** section, add:

```toml
GROQ_API_KEY = "gsk_your_actual_groq_api_key_here"
```

⚠️ **Important:** 
- Use TOML format (with quotes)
- Must match the variable name in your `.env` file

### Step 5: Deploy

1. Click **"Deploy!"**
2. Wait for the app to build (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`

### Step 6: Share Your App

Copy the URL and share it with anyone! They can use the app without needing API keys.
